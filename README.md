Instructions for use: double click the executable icon. The program will have buttons for quitting from each game to the main menu screen. The ping pong game uses the                        WASD keys and arrow keys for moving the paddles up and down the frame when playing. When running the ping pong game you have to input the                               winning number of points you want in the little box. The snake game uses the arrow keys for the snake to move around. The tic tac toe game just                         needs you touse the mouse to click the buttons on the grid to add the X or O.
Tools used: no external tools or libraries were used, just Java.
Concepts used: Ping Pong - a While Loop was used to run the game. If statements were used to check for various game aspects such as collision detection. The game                             panel, game frame, and paddles were broken down into multiple classes. 
               Tic Tac Toe - a for loop and nested if statements are used to check which player put down their sign and passes the turn to the next                                      player. An if statement was used to determine which player starts first. Nested if statements were used to check which player had the winning combination.
               Snake - The entire game is contained in one class and makes use of several private class variables for various game elements. It makes use of nested if                           statements to check if the snake's head position is equal to the apple's position, to check for collison with the boundaries, and check for                               collisions with itself.
Assumptions: We assume the system will be used for the obvious reasons of playing a game.
Limitations: Our game cannot bake a cake.
